# LangChain integration for pgvector, pgvectorscale, and pgai

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a popular framework for development applications powered by LLMs. pgai on Timescale has a native LangChain integration, enabling you to use it as a vector store and leverage all its capabilities in your applications built with LangChain.

Here are resources about using pgai on Timescale with LangChain:

- [Getting started with LangChain and pgvectorscale](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/timescalevector): You'll learn how to use pgai on Timescale for (1) semantic search, (2) time-based vector search, (3) self-querying, and (4) how to create indexes to speed up queries.
- [PostgreSQL Self Querying](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query/timescalevector_self_query): Learn how to use pgai on Timescale with self-querying in LangChain.
- [Learn more about pgai on Timescale and LangChain](https://blog.langchain.dev/timescale-vector-x-langchain-making-postgresql-a-better-vector-database-for-ai-applications/):  A blog post about the unique capabilities that pgai on Timescale brings to the LangChain ecosystem.
