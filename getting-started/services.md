# Create your first $SERVICE_LONG

<CloudIntro />


<ServiceOverview />

To start using $CLOUD_LONG for your data:

1. [Create a $COMPANY account][create-an-account]: register in $CONSOLE to get a centralized point to administer and interact with your data.
1. [Create a $SERVICE_LONG][create-a-service]: that is, a PostgreSQL database instance, powered by [$TIMESCALE_DB][timescaledb], built for production, and extended with cloud features like transparent data tiering to object storage.
1. [Connect to your $SERVICE_LONG][connect-to-your-service]: to run queries, add and migrate your data from other sources.
1. [Create a hypertable][create-a-hypertable]: create a standard PostgreSQL table in your service, then convert it into a [hypertable][hypertables].

   Anything you can do with regular PostgreSQL tables, you can do with hypertables, just with better performance and improved user experience for time-series data.

<Install />

## Create a $SERVICE_LONG

Now that you have an active $COMPANY account, you create and manage your services in $CONSOLE. When you create a service, you give a structure for your future data, which you then add manually or migrate from other services. All relevant $CLOUD_LONG features under your pricing plan are automatically available when you create a service. 

<Procedure> 

1. In the [service creation page][create-service], choose **Time Series and Analytics**.
   ![Create Timescale Cloud service](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/images/console-create-service.png)

1. In **Create a service**, configure your service, then click **Create service**.

   Your service is constructed immediately and is ready to use.

1. Click **Download the config** and store the configuration information you need to connect to this service in a 
   secure location. 

   This file contains the passwords and configuration information you need to connect to your service using the
   $CONSOLE Cloud SQL editors, from the command line, or using third party database administration tools.

1. Follow the service creation wizard.   

If you choose to go directly to the service overview, [Connect to your service][connect-to-your-service] 
shows you how to connect.

</Procedure> 

## Connect to your service

A Timescale service comes with access control to its data. To be able to run queries and perform other operations, connect to the service with credentials generated during its creation.

<Connect />

## Create a hypertable

<CreateAHypertable />

And that is it, you are up and running. Enjoy developing with $COMPANY.
